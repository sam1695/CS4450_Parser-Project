# CS4450_Parser-Project
This contains deliverables 1, 2, and 3 for CS4450's end of semester parser project. 

Our Python parser was built using ANTLR. 

To generate the parse tree for this project, follow these steps: 

1. Navigate to this website: http://lab.antlr.org/ 
	ANTLR lab is an online tool that allows you to test your grammars without having to make any installations on your computer. We used this site to visualize our grammars as well. 

2. Copy the content of the g4 file and paste it into the parser section. 
3. Delete the contents in the lexer tab (located to the left of the parser tab). 
4. Copy the deliverable.py code. Paste it into the input section. 
5. The name of the start rule should be program. 
6. Click the green “run” button to generate the parse tree. 

Once you click run, the parse tree should be generated.

These are the steps we took to generate our parse trees for each deliverable. We changed the g4 code on the website directly so we could see our changes reflected immediately, and then copy-pasted it into a file on an IDE IDE (VS Code or Pycharm) so we had a local copy of it. 

This website also shows you any errors that occurred while trying to run the program, and we used these in our debugging process.
